== Specs
* 25 failures 
  10 urls_spec - FIXED
  15 integration_spec
    Seems to be failing to mock the view rendering in the integration tests. - change of rails/rspec version?

== Function
* Accumulate responders, rather than overwriting, ie.
  response_for(:edit) do |format|
    format.js
  end
  response_for(:new, :edit)
    format.html
    # keeps format.js
  end
  - DONE based on work by http://github.com/adzap
* Resourceful::Default::Accessors.current_object_name
